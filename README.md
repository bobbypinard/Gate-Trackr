# Gate-Trackr
Gate Trackr is a project of AtLink Communications.

All the initial code was developed by myself, Bobby Pinard, Paul Bauer, Toan Nguyen, and Ahmad Harmouch. It was a project we worked on at a summer Internship at AtLink Communications Inc. under Nick Davis and Dilhar Padilla. 

This project uses OpenCV, Python, the NumPy, SciPy , and MatPlotLib Python2 libraries on the back end, and HTML5, BootStrap, PHP, JavaScript, JointJS, and CSS3
