# Gate-Trackr
Gate Trackr was a project of AtLink Communications.

All the initial code was developed by myself, Bobby Pinard, Paul Bauer, Toan Nguyen, and Ahmad Harmouch. It was a project we worked on during a summer Internship at AtLink Communications Inc. under Nick Davis and Dilhar Padilla. 

This project uses OpenCV, Python, the NumPy, SciPy, and MatPlotLib Python2 libraries on the back end, and HTML5, BootStrap, PHP, JavaScript, JointJS, and CSS3

**** USAGE ****
